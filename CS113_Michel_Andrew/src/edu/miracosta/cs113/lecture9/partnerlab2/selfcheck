2. For the items in the 5-element table of Table 7.3,
    compute hashCode() % table.length for length of 7 and 13.
    What would be the position of each word in tables of these
    sizes using open addressing and linear probing?
    Answer the same question for chaining.

3. The following table stores Integer keys with the int values shown.
    Show one sequence of insertions that would store the keys as shown.
    Which elements were placed in their current position because of
    collisions?  Show the table that would be formed by chaining.
