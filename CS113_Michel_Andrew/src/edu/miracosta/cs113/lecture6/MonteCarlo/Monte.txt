1. Using 3 printers, given 100 print jobs, with print jobs varying from 1-50 pages per job, simulate processing the jobs
2. Assume a print request is made every minute, printers can print 10 pages per minute
3. Indicate which printer each job was printed on
4. QueueA small jobs, QueueB medium jobs, QueueC large jobs
5. PrinterA openlane, PrinterB openlane, PrinterC fastlane

1. QueueA small jobs less than 10 pages
2. QueueB medium jobs less than 20 pages
3. QueueC large jobs more than 20 pages

/*
1. if PrinterA is empty, if any pages in small queue, move to PrinterA. else if any pages in medium queue, move to PrinterA.
2. if PrinterB is empty, if any pages in medium queue, move to PrinterB. else if any pages in large queue, move to PrinterB
3. if PrinterC is empty, if any pages in medium queue, move to PrinterC. else if any pages in large queue, move to PrinterC
