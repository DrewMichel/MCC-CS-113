 *      Use a HashMap to store the frequency counts for all the words
 *      in a large text document.  When you are done, display the
 *      contents of this HashMap.  Next, create a set view of the Map
 *      and store its contents in an array.  Then sort the array based
 *      on the key value and display it.  Finally, sort the array in
 *      decreasing order by frequency and display it.
